Auto Upload JFU Script
======================

This is a Python script for testing the JFU vulnerability on Joomla! sites. The script takes two inputs, a path file and a list file. The path file should contain a list of file paths to test for the vulnerability, and the list file should contain a list of website URLs to test.

Dependencies
------------

This script requires the following dependencies to be installed:

`pip install requests termcolor`

`pip install requests requests`

Usage
-----

1.  Download or clone the script from the repository.
2.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3.  Run the script using the following command: `python jfu.py`
4.  The script will prompt you to input the path to your path file and your list file.
5.  Once you have entered the file paths, the script will begin testing each website URL in the list file for the JCE File Upload vulnerability using the paths listed in the path file.
6.  The script will output whether the website is vulnerable or not, and if it is vulnerable, it will attempt to upload a file.
7.  If the file is successfully uploaded, the script will output the uploaded file's URL.

Note: It is recommended that you use a large list of URLs to test, as well as a comprehensive list of paths to test. This will increase the likelihood of finding vulnerable websites.

Disclaimer
----------

This script should only be used for testing purposes on websites that you have permission to test. Do not use this script to attack or exploit websites without explicit permission from the website owner. The author of this script is not responsible for any misuse or illegal activities carried out using this script.
